# Executive Summary: Hospital Readmission Prediction Business Impact

## Problem Overview
- **Current Readmission Rate:** 11.2% (2271 out of 20354 patients)
- **Average Cost Per Readmission:** $15,000
- **Total Annual Readmission Cost:** $34,065,000.00

## Model-Based Intervention Strategy
The predictive model identifies patients at high risk of readmission, allowing targeted interventions that are more cost-effective than applying interventions universally.

- **Intervention Cost Per Patient:** $500
- **Estimated Intervention Effectiveness:** 40% reduction in readmission risk

## Key Findings

### 1. Financial Impact
- **Potential Annual Savings:** $120,500.00 using the model-based approach
- **Return on Investment (ROI):** 512.8%
- **Net Savings Per Patient:** $5.92

### 2. Optimized Risk Threshold
- **Optimal Risk Score Threshold:** 0.10
- **Expected Net Benefit at Optimal Threshold:** $4,149,000.00
- **Expected ROI at Optimal Threshold:** 52.8%

### 3. Clinical Impact
- **Potential Readmissions Prevented:** 9.6 patients annually
- **Cost Per Prevented Readmission:** $2,447.92

## Projected Impact by Hospital Size
| Hospital Size | Annual Patients | Intervention Patients | Prevented Readmissions | Net Annual Benefit |
|---------------|----------------|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Small | 100 | 77 | 3.9 | $20,384.20 |
| Medium | 500 | 385 | 19.7 | $101,921.00 |
| Large | 2,000 | 1,542 | 78.6 | $407,683.99 |
| System | 10,000 | 7,714 | 393.0 | $2,038,419.97 |

## Recommendations
1. **Implement Risk Prediction System:** Deploy the machine learning model to identify high-risk patients at discharge
2. **Establish Targeted Intervention Program:** Focus resources on patients above the optimal risk threshold
3. **Track and Measure Outcomes:** Monitor actual readmission rates and adjust the model and thresholds as needed
4. **Expand Data Collection:** Incorporate additional variables like social determinants of health to improve prediction accuracy

The analysis demonstrates that the predictive model approach is significantly more cost-effective than either doing nothing or applying interventions universally.
